        <p class="paragraph"><B>Goals</B></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Once thing I wish to become 
        is a game developer. This isn't going to be easy. 
        However, by passing this class and perhaps learning 
        how to model in college or university, I can achieve this.
        <p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Strengths</b></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I'm a man, or boy,
        of ideas. I've worked with video game 
        developing, and my group would consider me 
        ambitious. They shown fascination with my 
        ideas, and I believe that with the skills 
        I learn here, I can create some neat stuff</p>
        <p class="paragraph">People would also consider
        a very honest and blunt person. If there is an
        issue, I will speak about it. I am far from
        perfect, but I can acknowledge the weaknesses
        of aanybody, even myself. I've seen the issues
        my art, my time handling, and motivation. I've
        seen the issues with my teams persistence and
        orginization.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am looking forward to
        the future, and hopefully I can develop the game
        I've dreamt of. Thank you for reading.</p>
